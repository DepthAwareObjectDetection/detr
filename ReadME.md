# Depth Adaptive Detection Transformer
![alt text](images/github-mark.svg)
## Introduction
Stereo cameras are ubiquitous in autonomous vehicles. Can depth information from these cameras improve the detection performance of a state-of-the-art object detector? 
We investigate the use of depth aware convolution layers such as [ShapeConv](https://github.com/DepthAwareObjectDetection/ShapeConv) and [Depth Adaptive CNN](https://github.com/DepthAwareObjectDetection/Depth-Adapted-CNN) in the [DeTR](https://github.com/DepthAwareObjectDetection/detr) object detector.
